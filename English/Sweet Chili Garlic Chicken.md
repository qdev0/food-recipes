## Ingredients

- Chicken breast (preferably 1kg, cut into smaller cubed pieces)
- Chicken or meat seasoning (details provided later) (If unavailable, use a little salt, sweet paprika, and hot paprika)
- Heinz Garlic Chili Sauce (half a bottle should be enough, adjust to taste)
- 1-2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes (optional, adjust according to desired spiciness)
- 3-5 cloves of garlic (if you have a sensitive stomach, you can omit or use fewer cloves)
- Olive oil (detailed amount provided in preparation and cooking)

## Preparation

- Start by cutting the chicken into cubes or small pieces. Then, add the chicken or meat seasoning and 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil, and mix the chicken well.
- You can marinate it for half an hour if desired, but it's not necessary.

## Cooking Technique

- Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a pan and heat it up. Add the chicken before the oil gets too hot, then stir-fry it over high heat for 3-4 minutes.
- Afterwards, reduce the heat to medium, add the Heinz Garlic Chili Sauce, red pepper flakes, and garlic cloves.
- Once the sauce has reduced by around 70-80%, turn off the heat, let it rest for 2-3 minutes, and it's ready.
