# Sweet Sour Chicken
## Ingredients
- Chicken fillet `1 kg, preferably smaller in size, half the size of regular fillets is good`
- Sumac `1-1.5 tablespoon, add more if you want it to be more sour` (If you cant find sumac use similar sour spices but be careful when using them in their volume)
- Red pepper flakes `1 tablespoon`
- Cumin `2-3 teaspoons`
- Sweet paprika `1 tablespoon`
- Salt `3-4 teaspoons`
- Olive oil `enough to cover the surface of the chicken and help the spices stick, do not use too much`

## Cooking Technique
In a large, wide, and `thick granite or cast iron pan`, pour enough olive oil to wet the surface only, and turn on high heat until it reaches the vapor point, then keep the heat high throughout the cooking process.
Start grilling the chicken fillets one by one. The cooking time depends on the temperature of the pan and the stove, so test it yourself. As a small trick, you can turn the chicken over when the edges start to turn white, and if you cook the other side for a similar time, it will give the same result.

Important note: `Do not use too much oil, as it changes the feeling of the dish entirely.`
